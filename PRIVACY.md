# Privacy Policy

**Procreate Viewer** — Last updated: February 20, 2026

## Overview

Procreate Viewer is a native macOS application that runs entirely on your device. It is designed with privacy as a core principle.

## Data Collection

**Procreate Viewer does not collect any data.** Specifically:

- **No personal information** is collected, stored, or transmitted
- **No analytics or tracking** of any kind
- **No network connections** — the app operates fully offline
- **No telemetry** — no crash reports, usage statistics, or diagnostic data are sent anywhere
- **No cookies or identifiers** — the app does not use cookies, device identifiers, or advertising identifiers

## File Access

Procreate Viewer accesses only the files you explicitly open or select through macOS file dialogs. The app uses Apple's App Sandbox, which restricts file access to user-selected locations only. Files are processed locally on your Mac and are never uploaded or shared.

When extracting from iPad backups, the app reads the backup database and files directly from your local filesystem. No data leaves your device.

## Third-Party Services

Procreate Viewer does not integrate with any third-party services, SDKs, or APIs.

## Children's Privacy

Procreate Viewer does not collect data from anyone, including children.

If this privacy policy is updated, the changes will be posted here with an updated date.
